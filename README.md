# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-using-Pygame

In this project, I have tried to implement my learnings of DSA in Python and made a traditional Tic-Tac-Toe Game using PyGame Module of Python language.
### Tech Stack - Python, VSCode, PyGame

# What is PyGame?
Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language.

### Advantages of PyGame:
1. Multi core CPUs can be used easily
2. Uses optimized C and Assembly code for core functions
3. Comes with many operating systems
4. Simple to Use and Portable
